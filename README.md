6	## Project Description
7	
8	Design and implement a **Single-page application** using [Angular 2](https://angular.io/)
9	
10	It can be a discussion forum, blog system, e-commerce site, online gaming site, social network, or any other web application by your choice.
11	
12	The application should have a:
13	
14	- **public part** (accessible without authentication)
15	- **private part** (available for registered users)
16	
17	### Public Part
18	
19	The **public part** of your projects should be **visible without authentication**.
20	This public part could be the application start page, application statistics, the user login and user registration forms, as well as the public data of the users, e.g. the blog posts in a blog system, the public offers in a bid system, the products in an e-commerce system, etc.
21	
22	### Private Part (Registered users area)
23	
24	**Registered users** should have personal area in the web application accessible after **successful login**.
25	This area could hold for example the user's profiles management functionality, the user's offers in a bid system, the user's posts in a blog system, the user's photos in a photo sharing system, the user's contacts in a social network, etc.
26	
27	## Technical Requirements
28	
29	Your Web application should use the following technologies, frameworks and development techniques:
30	
31	- At least **8 different public dynamic web pages**
32	- At least **7 different private (authenticated) dynamic web pages**
33	- At least **10 different** partial components
34	  - Partial, as not a whole page
35	- Responsive UI with good UX
36	- Most of the data should be loaded from a web server
37	  - You can use Firebase, parse.com, Telerik Back-end Services, or any other
38	  - You can use your own server written on Node.js, ASP.NET, or any other framework
39	- Load all data using services
40	- Use animations
41	- Create at least **3 different pipes**
42	- Create at least **3 different directives**
43	- Setup and use tslint
44	- Use **TypeScript**
45	- Use the **best practices** for software development and Object-oriented design
46	- Use Dependency Injection
47	
48	##  General Requirements
49	
50	- Use Git
51	  - Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, or other
52	- Brief **documentation** of the project and the project architecture
53	  - As `README.md` file at the root of the github repository
54	
55	### Deliverables
56	
57	- Record a short video showcasing your application
58	  - ~1-2 minutes, just show the interesting features
59	  - Do not record register/login functionality, this is not interesting...
60	- Upload your application in the cloud
61	  - MS Azure, HerokuCloud, Amazon, all are fine
62	- Register your application at [Our Showcase System](http://best.telerikacademy.com)
63	  - Link to the live application
64	  - Link to the video
65	  - Link to the github repository
66	
67	### Public Project Defense
68	
69	Each team will have to make a **public defense** of its work in front of a trainer (for about 30 minutes), in which each of the team members will answer to the trainer's questions individually.
70	
71	The public defense includes:
72	
73	- Live **demonstration** of the developed web application (prepare sample data).
74	- Explain application structure and its back-end and front-end **source code**
75	- Show the **commit logs** in the source control repository to prove a contribution from all team members.
76	- May include a simple task for each team member
77	  - The task must be implemented immediately
78	
79	### Give Feedback about Your Teammates
80	
81	You will be invited to **provide feedback** about all your teammates, their attitude to this project, their technical skills, their team working skills, their contribution to the project, etc.
82	The feedback is important part of the project evaluation so **take it seriously** and be honest.
